## Systemd user service

These scripts are used to start a `systemd --user` session.

The service file will do a few different things

1. Initialize a logind session using the PAM login module on /dev/tty5
2. Load environment variables from /etc/profile into the systemd --user session
3. Load user environment variables from \$HOME/.config/systemd/environment
4. Start the systemd --user session as the specified user, starting the
   default.target

## Enabling the service

    systemctl start user-session@username

Enabling the service wil conflict with the getty on /dev/tty5 and will cause
systemd --user to start on startup.

## Authenticating a user session

Since the systemd --user session will be autostarted on boot as your user it's
not necessary to login. However, if you like the added security of requiring a
login to access the session it's as easy as changing what the default.target
starts.

Instead of having your default target start x11 and a window manager, just start
the dbus.service (this is required or else `systemctl --user` and `systemd --user`
can't talk).

Then in your `.profile` put something like this:

```bash
if systemctl -q is-active user-session@username
then
	# Bring up systemd --user to the specified target
	systemctl --user start some-target.target

	# Exit the VT
	clear && logout
fi
```

Then you can login via any of your gettys to start your session services. You
may want to script it so different targets are started based on how you login.
For example, when I login from tty1 it starts my graphical.target if it's not
active, otherwise it starts my console.target (and doesn't exit).

## Environment script

When your user session is started, you will most likely want to have some
additional environment variables. For example, setting XDG_HOME directories.

You can create a bash script `~/.config/bash/environment` that you can use to
set environment variables for the systemd user instance. It would probably be a
good idea to put most of your exported environment variables in here and source
the script in your `.profile` as well.

## Installation

This package was designed for Arch Linux, but should work just fine on other
distributions using systemd.

Arch Linux: [See the PKGBUILD file
here](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/PKGBUILDs/tree/main/systemd-user-sessions-git/PKGBUILD)

Other users: Simply copy the contesnt of the systemd directory into your systemd
library directoy (usally `/usr/lib/systemd`)
